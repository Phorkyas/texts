I have said that the soul is not more than the body, 
And I have said that the body is not more than the soul, 
And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one’s self is, 
And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own 
funeral drest in his shroud, 
And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth, 
And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the 
learning of all times, 
And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it 
may become a hero, 
And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe, 
And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed 
before a million universes. 
 
And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God, 
or I who am curious about each am not curious about God, 
(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and 
about death.) 
 
I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least, 
Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself. 
 
Why should I wish to see God better than this day? 
I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then, 
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass, 
I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d 
by God’s name, 
And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe’er I go, 
Others will punctually come for ever and ever.

And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to 
try to alarm me. 
 
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes, 
I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting, 
I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors, 
And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape. 
 
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not 
offend me, 
I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing, 
I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish’d breasts of melons. 
 
And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, 
(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.) 
 
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven, 
O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions, 
If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing? 
 
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, 
Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight, 
Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay 
in the muck, 
Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs. 
 
I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night, 
I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected, 
And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.

There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in me. 
 
Wrench’d and sweaty--calm and cool then my body becomes, 
I sleep--I sleep long. 
 
I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid, 
It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol. 
 
Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on, 
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me. 
 
Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters. 

Do you see O my brothers and sisters? 
It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal 
life--it is Happiness. 
 
51 
The past and present wilt--I have fill’d them, emptied them. 
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future. 
 
Listener up there! what have you to confide to me? 
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening, 
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.) 
 
Do I contradict myself? 
Very well then I contradict myself, 
(I am large, I contain multitudes.) 
 
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab. 
 
Who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper? 
Who wishes to walk with me? 
 
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late? 
 
52 
The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab 
and my loitering. 
 
I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable, 
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

The last scud of day holds back for me, 
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds, 
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk. 
 
I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun, 
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags. 
 
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, 
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles. 
 
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, 
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, 
And filter and fibre your blood. 
 
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, 
Missing me one place search another, 
I stop somewhere waiting for you.
