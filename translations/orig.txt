The past and present wilt--I have fill’d them, emptied them. 
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future. 
 
Listener up there! what have you to confide to me? 
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening, 
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.) 
 
Do I contradict myself? 
Very well then I contradict myself, 
(I am large, I contain multitudes.) 
 
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab. 
 
Who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper? 
Who wishes to walk with me? 
 
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?

The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab 
and my loitering. 
 
I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable, 
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

The last scud of day holds back for me, 
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds, 
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk. 
 
I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun, 
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags. 
 
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, 
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles. 
 
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, 
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, 
And filter and fibre your blood. 
 
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, 
Missing me one place search another, 
I stop somewhere waiting for you.
